# What It Does
A website for an imaginary coffee house called "LionBear." My personal interest - coffee tasting newly revived into a web application.

# Tech Stacks
Vanilla CSS and HTML

# Accomplishment I am proud of
This is the first-ever web project I developed by myself without any external help. I referred to trendy website UI to provide better UX for customers of LionBear Coffee Roasters. It seems like the result came out really well!

# Challenges I encountered

# Future Improvements
